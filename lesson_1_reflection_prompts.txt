How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Instead of viewing over a thousand lines of code, I only had to compare a couple dozen.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    If you make a mistake it is easy to go back to a version that worked.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Con - you could lose hours of work if you didn't commit and the computer crashes.
	pros - You can save critical points that you can go back to during the completion of logical changes.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    there can be multiple files in a project that work together which change together for example buttons with html, css, and js

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log shows the entire history of commits and view diff can compare two versions of the commit. 

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    I am feeling better about being able to view an older version of the document, compare them, and make changes.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    School projects
