When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
So you can colaborate with others and to backup data.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
branch and remote control. Also, want to pull when your local project is working before adding changes from github.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
forks - when using someone elses repository and want to build off of it to customize it for your own needs
clones - copy a repository onto your local machine
branches - allows you to work in modules. master branch should always be fully functional. branches let you continue building and testing.
